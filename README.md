# Spam_Classification_using-Word2Vec
In this project, I used different techniques such as BOW,TF-IDF,Word2vec and AVGWord2Vec(By google) to convert text or messages into vectors and compare each technique.



Word2vec is a popular technique for modelling word similarity by creating word vectors. It's a method that uses neural networks to model word-to-word relationships. Basically, the algorithm takes a large corpus of text as input and produces a vector, known as a context vector, as output
